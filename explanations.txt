G Cost is the cost of movement from the starting square to current square.
It is equal to one plus the cost of movement from the previous square.

H Cost is the estimated cost of movement from the current square to the final square.
The way H Cost is calculated in the screenshot is by the Manhattan distance method. 

F Cost is the sum of the G Cost and H Cost per square.
Each square has it's own F Cost. 

The F Costs for diagonal-going Paul make sense due to the cost of diagonal movement. Since four diagonal moves are necessary to reach the cake, they are employed. However, when cheaper moves are available they are used instead.

Similarly, the F Costs for hopping Paul make sense due to the cost off a hop. Since Paul cannot hop in a diagonal, that option is not used. While hopping is constly, it is necessary to reach the cake.

In order for Paul to reach the cake, he must move through at least one swamp tile. He chooses the least costly path by only moving through one tile - moving through two would be much more costly.
